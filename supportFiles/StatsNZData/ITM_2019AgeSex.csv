"Footnotes:"
"The standard error indicates the uncertainty of the provisional migration estimate. For example, the 95 percent confidence interval is +/-1.96 standard errors."
"These intervals reflect the model uncertainty, not the extent of future revisions to provisional data. Standard errors are non-additive."
"Owing to rounding, individual figures may not sum to stated totals."
